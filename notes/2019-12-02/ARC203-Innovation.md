# ARC203 Innovation At Speed 

What does it take to innovate quickly? In this session, we address how blockers to innovation, such as culture, skills, antiquated processes, and board-level concerns, can stand in the way of business agility. We map out a pathway to digital transformation, including new metrics for success, integration of real-world best practices from enterprises, and the most effective organizational patterns, as we integrate the business with development and operations.

- There is no economy of scale in software
- Smaller changes are better


## Scale

### Distributed Optimized Capacity
- cloud native principles
- pay as you go, afterward
- self-service, no waiting
- globally distributed by default
- cross-zone/-region avaialbility models
- high utilization - turn idle resources off
- immutable code deployments

## Strategic


## Containers vs serverless comparision
see pictures

| Containers | Serverless || -- 

## Observabilty high to low
- high - lambda functoin with no side effects
- microservice that does on e thing
- monolith with tracing and loging
- low monolith with logging
- Books: Engineering a SAfer World - systems thinkinh applied to safety by nancy g leveson
- STPA model 0- 


## Epidemic example
- linux leap - second bug



## Chaos Architecture
- four layers
- you can only be as strong as your weakest link
- failures are a system problem - lack of 
- dependble 
- cloud gives the automation for chaos engineering

- testing failure mitigation
