# ARC203 Innovation At Speed

What does it take to innovate quickly? In this session, we address how blockers to innovation, such as culture, skills, antiquated processes, and board-level concerns, can stand in the way of business agility. We map out a pathway to digital transformation, including new metrics for success, integration of real-world best practices from enterprises, and the most effective organizational patterns, as we integrate the business with development and operations.
