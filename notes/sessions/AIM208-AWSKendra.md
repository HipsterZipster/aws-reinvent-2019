# Transform The Way You Search And Interact With Enterprise Data Using AI
20% of the time looking for information
44% of the time canâ€™t find the information

## Problems
* Low accuracy
* Keyword engines just look for words, not a knowledge graph
* Enterprise data is spread across different silos

## Rethinking Enterprise Search (Amazon Kendra)
* Continuous improvements
* ML models built to understand search queries, i.e., not keyword search
* Native connectors to pull data from multiple sources
* Reading comprehension
* FAQ matching
* Document ranking

* Where is the IT support desk? Location
* How long is maternity leave? Quantity
* How do I configure my VPN? Paragraph

* 16 levels of domain expertise, including financial services

* Captures click-through and user feedback
* Retrains models periodically

### Relevance Tuning
* Authoritative data sources
    * Control priority of sources
* Document freshness
    * Control priority of document metadata (i.e., recent documents)
* Authors or departments
    * Control priority of documents based on the query context (i.e., HR queries prioritize HR documents)
* Upvotes and popularity
